# The PyCantRead Project (In progress)
The PyCantRead project is a python source code obfuscation project that obfuscates code **written with the imperative programming paradigm**. This is a "mini" project that 
supplements my main project the [PyIris-backdoor project](https://github.com/angus-y/PyIris-backdoor) as such this obfuscater will obfuscate code following the imperative 
programming paradigm which my project mainly implements NOT the object-oriented programming paradigm which many python projects are written in. 

# Why should you use this project?
In all honesty you shouldn't. PyCantRead is not meant to be a functional, useful or even efficient source code obfuscater. I wrote it for fun just to challenge myself and grow as 
a programmer. Since this is a supplement to my main project the [PyIris-backdoor project](https://github.com/angus-y/PyIris-backdoor) it was written with the design considerations 
of the PyIris payload source code in mind. The PyIris payload source code is written with the imperative programming paradigm not the object-oriented programming paradigm. As such
this obfuscater will only obfuscate code regarding functions and not classes. If you are looking for a serious library to obfuscate and compress your code I highly recommend 
[PyMinifier](https://liftoff.github.io/pyminifier/).
